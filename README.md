  Simulations
</h1>
<p align="center">
  A simulation is an approximate imitation of the operation of a process 
  or system; that represents its operation over time. Phew! Done with 
  Google definition. Anyway, here I try to animate different scenarios, 
  both real and fictional. Hope you enjoy them and leave a star if you 
  like what you see.
